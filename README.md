## roadrunner

Roadrunner is a prototype package for an eBird roadtrip planner. It tries to answer the following question: 

 - _Which eBird hotspots along my itinerary have the best chance to be harboring species I have never seen?_

<!-- It is the example package for the CSEE 2021 Workshop titled: [R Package Development for Research: an Introduction](https://github.com/VLucet/R_pkg_dev_for_research_CSEE_2021) -->
